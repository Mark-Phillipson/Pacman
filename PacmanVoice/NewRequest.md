Can we add a new feature where we can enter a batch of direction commands all at once Apply them  all with voice commands only.

 for example we could say batch entry to enter batch mode, then say south, east, west, north to queue up those commands. Then we could say apply batch to execute them all in sequence. During batch entry

 the game would automatically pause until we  issue the voice command apply batch to apply the commands. This would allow for more strategic planning and reduce the need for constant interaction during gameplay.

 also could we have a setting in the game where we can't set the game speed overall to be slower or faster based on our preference
